Get started for the first time:
	>git clone <repository url>
   - this creates a folder containing the entire repository

When you start working:
	>git pull
   - this gives you the most up-to-date versions

When you want to save your changes:
	>git add <filename>
   - lets git know that you either made a new file or modified an existing file
	>git commit -m 'some notes about your changes'
	>git push
